# Volunteering
This is a repository for a web application that aims to connect volunteers with non-profit (and other) organisations and people. The goal is to have charities (non-profit organisations, people) list their needs, and to give users the option to contact said charities to fill that need.

Further, giving volunteers the opportunity to list *themselves* with their skills (and have them endorsed by charities) for the charities to contact as well.

This is a large scope project, during which I also learn working with Django, improve my web design and web development. As such, the project will unravel slowly.
